Looking back, I thought '64 was shaping up to be a pretty good year. No more drinking and no more mercenary sec work. Stripping offshore wind farms for the OEZ, just me and a plasma cutter, 400 feet above sea level. Then I got the recall alert. Read them up on a turbine, in the smell of cooking ozone. They covered every angle--better pay, amnesty for any combine wars you'd fought in, guaranteed citizenship... We should have thought "OK, what's the catch?" But what we did think was "I guess we're better than the bots after all." Big talk from Herres about pride and duty - smart guy. He was right. I'd been proud to be a U.S. soldier. I jumped at the chance to be one again. And look what I landed in.
