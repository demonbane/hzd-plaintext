Uh...so that happened. Called security. And janitorial, to clean up the coffee that was spilled - actually, more like thrown. I wasn't aware that the Indo-Malay Combine grows coffee beans. And that FreshGrounds' "acquisition team" has tried to take their fields, by force, repeatedly. I think Commandant Daing had Agnew by the hair for a second there. Who schedules these things? I'm going to drop a line to Sales. This can't happen again.
