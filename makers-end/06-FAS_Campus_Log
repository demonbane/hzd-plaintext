FAS Campus Security Log

HIGH PRIORITY ALERT
Automated log note: All non-essential systems have entered hibernation.

HIGH PRIORITY ALERT:
Automated log note: Full lockdown has been initiated.

HIGH PRIORITY ALERT:
Due to the increasing frequency of violent protests targeting the campus, the security of FAS employees can no longer be guaranteed. Therefore, we have taken the difficult decision to shutter this facility indefinitely. Staff will be debrief on a block-by-block basis regarding proper procedure for archiving and/or disposal of project-related data and materials. Hi-Sec and a crisis team will then conduct exit review before ALL areas are locked down.

HIGH PRIORITY ALERT:
Priority messaging to all staff in E and F blocks: treat the current lockdown situation as an exercise but DO NOT attempt to release the hatches or otherwise exit the buildings.

HIGH PRIORITY ALERT:
A reminder that while Hi-Sec personnel remain committed to employee safety during the current unfortunate events, personal firearms MUST be relinquished when presenting for Identiscan.

HIGH PRIORITY ALERT:
Additional public access roads en route to the campus have now been closed to relieve waiting time at the outer security cordons. Hi-Sec reminds all staff that the campus remains off-limits to the public.

HIGH PRIORITY ALERT:
Following recent campus security issues, all staff are reminded that presenting for Identiscan and displaying your security badge prominently at all times for image analytics are both MANDATORY.

HIGH PRIORITY ALERT:
In light of recent acts of terrorism directed at the rapid transit system, Hi-Sec now offers a 'big brother' initiative to accompany staff traveling from off-site. Signup is required and strongly encouraged.
